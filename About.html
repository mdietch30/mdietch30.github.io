	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am a <b>Sophomore</b> from <b>Orange, CT</b>. I am a <b>Marketing major</b> at the <b>University of Maine</b>.  Check out the school website in the link below titled, "<u>UMaine</u>". For my entire life, until I started school at UMaine, I played baseball in the spring, summer and fall. My family is the definition of a baseball family so it has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I was a catcher, outfielder and occasionally pitched. I attended <b>Amity Regional High School</b> where I played baseball for all four years. I was also on the ski team at my school for all four years which included being a captain my senior year. I lettered in both sports. Since I have stopped playing baseball, I started coaching AAU travel ball. It has been a lot of fun and I enjoyed working with the kids, passing my knowledge on to them, and watching them grow throughout the summer. </p>
