	<h1>My Family</h1>
	<p>My family consists of my mom, Jody, my dad, Jeff, my brother, Howie, and my dog, Hank, who is a Vizsla Ridgeback. Hank is just over a year old. My family just recently put down my 14 year old yellow lab, Hayley, that I miss very much. My mother is an executive director at Congregation Beth El in Norwalk, CT. My dad is a mailman in Milford, CT. My brother Howie is a high school history teacher at Amistad High School in New Haven, CT. He is also a high school baseball coach. </p>
