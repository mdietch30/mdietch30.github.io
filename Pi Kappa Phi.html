	<p>I am a brother of Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity at the University of Maine. Our chapter was founded in 2015. We have around 60 brothers in our chapter. Our house is located at 380 College Ave. A cool thing about Pi Kappa Phi is that we are the only fraternity in the nation that founded, owns and operates our own philanthropy. Our philanthropy is The Ability Experience. The Ability Experience, formerly Push America, is a nonprofit organization that serves people with disabilities.</p>
